```

Wowza needs several user actions on the interactive prompt portion of the installer:
- an acknowledgement of acceptance of their terms
- an administrative user added for using the Wowza console
- a password for the administrative user
- confirmation of that password
- Wowza license key
- an acknowledgement of whether or not you want Wowza to start at boot

Those values can be edited in the template/script.exp.erb file.
